> **⚠️ Warning**
>
> When using this plugin to convert viewport units (e.g., vw) or other methods that generate scalable views using dynamic root element `font-size` combined with rem, these methods cannot trigger the browser's zoom functionality (you can trigger it by pressing <kbd>CMD/Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>+/-</kbd> simultaneously), and thus do not meet [accessibility standards for zooming](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-zh/#resize-text), posing accessibility issues. See an [accessibility experiment on vw scalable views](https://github.com/wswmsword/web-experiences/tree/main/a11y/mobile-vw-viewport).

A PostCSS plugin that converts fixed-size views based on specific widths into views that scale proportionally with the width, and provides methods to stop zooming the view beyond a certain width. Such views are commonly used for mobile page adaptation. postcss-mobile-forever can be used in conjunction with [scale-view](https://github.com/wswmsword/scale-view): the former for compilation and the latter for runtime. postcss-mobile-forever features include:

- Conversion of viewport units for scalable views (*px->vw*);
- Two methods to limit the maximum width of scalable views:
  - Generating media queries for desktop and landscape (*@media*),
  - Or using CSS functions to limit the maximum viewport unit value (*min(vw, px)*);
- Correction of elements with `fixed` positioning, supporting [logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts_of_logical_properties_and_values) transformation.

<details>
<summary>
Using media queries to limit the maximum width allows setting separate maximum widths for desktop and landscape views.
</summary>

You can view an [online example](https://wswmsword.github.io/examples/mobile-forever/vanilla/), where you can rotate the screen, resize the window, and view the display effects on different screens. The text at the top will indicate whether the current view is mobile portrait, mobile landscape, or desktop.

- Mobile portrait uses scalable (vw) views optimized for mobile portrait screens;
- Mobile landscape uses a *centered smaller fixed width* optimized for mobile landscape screens;
- Tablets, laptops, and desktops use a *centered larger fixed width* optimized for mobile portrait screens;
- Wearable devices use scalable (vw) views optimized for mobile portrait screens.

Below are three images demonstrating the effects of media queries generated by this plugin for mobile, mobile landscape, and desktop views:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><img src="./images/portrait.png" alt="Display effect on mobile" /></td>
		<td><img src="./images/landscape.png" alt="Display effect on mobile landscape" /></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><img src="./images/desktop.png" alt="Display effect on desktop" /></td>
	</tr>
</table>

In the "Example" section, you can find examples provided in the source code for running locally to verify the demonstration effects, or you can view the online examples mentioned at the beginning of the document.

> You can also use *px2vw* to handle viewport unit conversions (for mobile portrait adaptation), disable the viewport unit conversion feature of this plugin by opening `disableMobile`. This approach only applies to the second method mentioned above, which generates media queries.
</details>

> If you use [postcss-px-to-viewport](https://github.com/evrone/postcss-px-to-viewport/) to implement scalable interfaces and do not want the interface to stretch across the entire screen on large devices, making it difficult to browse, you can use this plugin to stop scaling the interface after reaching a suitable width (limiting the maximum width).

## Installation

Install the latest version via npm (based on postcss@^8.0.0) (or `yarn add -D postcss postcss-mobile-forever` for Yarn):
```bash
npm install --save-dev postcss postcss-mobile-forever
```

Install the latest compatible version via npm (based on postcss@^6.0.0) (or `yarn add -D postcss-mobile-forever@legacy` for Yarn):

```bash
npm install postcss-mobile-forever@legacy --save-dev
```

Check the [legacy mobile-forever documentation](./README_LEGACY.md), The current compatible version does not support handling [logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts_of_logical_properties_and_values).

<details>
<summary>
After installation, import it into the postcss.config.js configuration file or other framework configuration files.
</summary>

There are several [configuration formats](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/postcss-loader#config) for `postcss.config.js`. Here is one of the configuration methods:

```javascript
import mobile from 'postcss-mobile-forever' // <---- Here
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'
// omitted...
{
	postcss: {
		plugins: [
			autoprefixer(),
			mobile({ // <---- Here
				appSelector: '#app',
				viewportWidth: 375,
				maxDisplayWidth: 580,
			}),
		]
	}
}
// omitted...
```

</details>

A large number of configuration parameters are approaching, no need to worry, everything is under control. Before that, you can try the most basic configuration parameters. The following is a basic configuration, which means that the application is being developed based on a width of `750px`. After conversion by mobile-forever, in the browser, the application view will be limited to a proportional scaling within a width of `600px`. When the width is greater than `600px`, the view will not change, and the root element `#app` of the application view is centered in the browser window:

```json
{
  "viewportWidth": 750,
  "appSelector": "#app",
  "maxDisplayWidth": 600
}
```

Each of the following items is optional.

| Name | Type | Default | Desc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| rootContainingBlockList_NOT_LR | string[] | [] | 用于根包含块的，非 left、right 的自定义属性 |
| ancestorContainingBlockList | string[] | [] | 用于非根包含块的自定义属性，这些属性值不会被转换，但是会添加到桌面端和横屏，用于避免优先级问题 |

也可以通过在样式文件中添加注释，来标记局部的尺寸该如何转换，下面是一些标记注释：
- `/* apply-without-convert */`，标记在一行属性之后，表示属性不经过转换，将直接添加到桌面端和横屏（可用于属性覆盖的情况）；
- `/* root-containing-block */`，标记在选择器上面，用于表示当前选择器的包含块是根元素，是浏览器窗口（如果选择器中已有“`position: fixed;`”，则无需标注该注释）；
- `/* not-root-containing-block */`，标记在选择器上面，用于表示当前选择器所属元素的包含块不是根元素；
- `/* mobile-ignore-next */`，标记在一行属性的上面，表示下一行属性不需要进行转换；
- `/* mobile-ignore */`，标记在一行属性后面，表示当前行属性不需要进行转换；
- `/* vertical-writing-mode */`，标记在选择器上面，表示当前选择器是纵向书写模式，内部的逻辑属性需要被转换。

虽然配置选项的数量看起来很多，但是只需要指定选项 viewportWidth 后，就可以输出伸缩视图的结果，通常我们还需要让伸缩视图具有最大宽度，只要再添加 appSelector 和 maxDisplayWidth，即可完成。开发中，如果在浏览器看到了宽屏的视图有和在移动端视图不一样的地方，再考虑配置其它选项也不迟。
</summary>

下面的配置会激活第一种方法，使用 CSS 函数限制视口单位的最大值，当屏幕宽度超过 600px 后，视图不会再变化：

```json
{
  "viewportWidth": 750,
  "appSelector": "#app",
  "maxDisplayWidth": 600
}
```

下面的配置会激活第二种方法，生成媒体查询，适配桌面端和横屏，桌面端视图的宽度是 600px，横屏的宽度是 425px：

```json
{
  "viewportWidth": 750,
  "appSelector": "#app",
  "enableMediaQuery": true
}
```

如果暂时不希望优化视图在大屏的可访问性，不做最大宽度的限制，可以像下面这样配置：

```json
{
  "viewportWidth": 750
}
```

## 单元测试与参与开发

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

修改源码后，编写单元测试，验证是否输出了预期的结果。另外，在文件夹 `example/` 内提供了一些范例，可以用来模拟生产环境使用插件的场景，这些范例项目中依赖的 `postcss-mobile-forever` 来自源码，因此当修改源码后，可以通过在范例里 `npm i` 安装依赖，然后本地运行，通过浏览器验证自己的修改是否符合预期。

如果您是移动端模版的开发者，成功引入 postcss-mobile-forever 之后，您可以按照“移动端模版和范例”一节的格式，提交 PR，将您的模版仓库以及在线演示地址添加到后续的列表中，这样可以为您的模版提供更多的曝光，也能够表示您的移动端模版具有良好的桌面端体验。

一起开发，让程序的变量命名更合适、性能和功能更好。

相比使用 CSS 函数，使用媒体查询限制宽度，生成的代码量更大。
</details>

查看[原理](./how-it-works.md)。

## 注意事项

插件提供了两个方法限制伸缩视图的最大宽度。使用媒体查询的方法会生成较多代码量，但是可以分别设置桌面端与横屏的不同最大宽度（[在线范例](https://wswmsword.github.io/examples/mobile-forever/vanilla/)，[配置](./example/vanilla/postcss.config.js)）；使用 CSS 函数的方法生成代码量较少，只能设置单个最大宽度（[在线范例](https://wswmsword.github.io/examples/mobile-forever/maxDisplayWidth/)，[配置](./example/others/maxDisplayWidth-vanilla/postcss.config.js)）。

appSelector 所在元素的居中属性会被占用，包括 `margin-left`、`margin-right`、`max-width`，如果开启了 border，`box-shadow` 会被占用。

默认情况，插件会把所有 fixed 定位的元素的包含块当成根元素，如果希望跳过处理非根元素的包含块，请在选择器上方添加注释，`/* not-root-containing-block */`，这样设置后，插件会知道这个选择器内的计算方式统一使用非根包含块的计算方式：

```css
/* not-root-containing-block */
.class {
  position: fixed;
  left: 50%;
}
```

> 对于 fixed 定位元素的包含块是祖先元素，而不是根元素（浏览器窗口，visual viewport）的条件，请查看“其它”一节。

<details>
<summary>
对于包含块，如果“position: fixed;”和“left: 0;”不在同一选择器，可以在需要重新计算的选择器上标记注释“/* root-containing-block */”（另一个方法是设置“rootContainingBlockSelectorList”参数）。
</summary>

```css
.position {
	position: fixed;
}
/* root-containing-block */
.top-box {
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	width: 66px;
	height: 66px;
	border-radius: 9px;
}
```
</details>

插件转换的是选择器中的属性的值，不转换 [At 规则](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule)中的属性，例如 `@font-face` 中的属性。

<details>
<summary>
展开查看关于“experimental.extract”选项的一些说明。
</summary>

- 打开选项后，样式文件会被分割为 `mobile.xxx.css`、`landscape.xxx.css` 和 `desktop.xxx.css`，这有利于使用代码分割进行产包优化;
- 该选项需要设置 [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) 的 `modules.getLocalIdent` 选项，需要从本插件导入 `remakeExtractedGetLocalIdent` 函数进行传递，这是为了防止选择器名称中的哈希值出现错误（哈希值会通过文件路径计算，而被分割的文件路径是不同的）；
- 暂时不支持热重载，可以仅在生产模式下打开该选项；
- 被分割的文件暂时不支持运行本插件（postcss-mobile-forever）后面的其它 postcss 插件；
- 如果使用 [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) 自动插入样式产包，需要注意顺序，顺序可以通过 `optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.[group].priority` 来决定，优先级越高，插入到 html 的顺序越靠前。

关于 CSS 自定义属性，默认情况下，所有和长度相关的属性，如果使用了自定义属性，都会被添加入桌面端和横屏，这可能会带来一些冗余的添加，也可能会有一些转换的错误，转换的错误和包含块相关。
</summary>

下面的例子，默认的情况，`--len-a` 的值在桌面端会被转为 `60px`，横屏会被转为 `42.5px`，但是可以看到实际的应用场景中，定位是 fixed，因此包含块是根包含块，所以默认的转换是错误的，正确的转换应该是，桌面端会被转为 `calc(50% - 240px)`，横屏会被转为 `calc(50% - 170px)`。
```css
:root {
  --len-a: 75px;
}
.rule {
  left: var(--len-a);
  position: fixed;
}
```

上面的例子中，如果要正确的转换，需要在配置中明确指定，`--len-a` 用于根包含块，并且被用于 `left` 属性：
```javascript
{
  // ...其它配置
  customLengthProperty: {
    rootContainingBlockList_LR: ["--len-a"]
  }
}
```

本插件媒体查询模式的目标是在不同尺寸的屏幕上展示**合适**的视图，在宽一点的屏幕上展示大一点的视图，在扁一点的屏幕上展示小一点的视图，在窄一些的屏幕展示移动端竖屏视图，而**非准确**地识别具体的设备或平台来应用对应视图。

使用插件转换后的浏览器兼容性情况：媒体查询模式下会利用 CSS 函数 `calc()`，因此兼容性略有降低，Opera Mini 完全不可用，max-display-width 模式利用了 CSS 函数 `max()`、`min()` 以及 `calc()`，会有兼容性问题，IE、Opera Mini、QQ 浏览器 13.1 完全不可用，具体可以查看 [caniuse min(), max()](https://caniuse.com/css-math-functions)、[caniuse calc()](https://caniuse.com/calc)。

## 期望效果

在不同设备上，[*duozhuayu.com*](https://www.duozhuayu.com/book)（多抓鱼）公用一套 UI，访问无障碍，没有巨大字体和全宽的问题。

多抓鱼官网用*百分比*单位做适配，最大宽度是 600px，小于这个宽度则向内挤压，大于这个宽度则居中移动端竖屏视图，这种小版心布局在不同尺寸屏幕的设备上，展示效果很好。这样的适配方法舍弃了对设计稿的“完美”还原，相应的，代码没有了预处理，更轻量了，没有了“完美”的限制，开发的过程也变得灵活，对于一种布局，有很多方式实现适配，而且，这样适配也能很好地触发浏览器的缩放功能，满足了[针对缩放的可访问性标准](https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-zh/#resize-text)。

## 其它

如果仅使用 postcss-px-to-viewport，并且项目无路由，可以通过 iframe 嵌套 vw 伸缩界面（<a href="https://github.com/evrone/postcss-px-to-viewport/issues/130#issuecomment-1641725322">来源链接</a>），来达到限制最大宽度的目的。
</summary>

```html
<style>
  body {
    margin: 0;
  }
  #iframe {
    max-width: 520px;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: block;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <!-- vw-index.html 为 postcss-px-to-viewport 转换后的伸缩界面 -->
  <iframe id="iframe" src="./vw-index.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>

- postcss-px-to-viewport，[*‌https://github.com/evrone/postcss-px-to-viewport*](https://github.com/evrone/postcss-px-to-viewport)，postcss 插件，用于将指定单位转为视口单位。
- postcss-px-to-clamp，[*https://github.com/wangguangyou/postcss-px-to-clamp*](https://github.com/wangguangyou/postcss-px-to-clamp)，postcss 插件，用于转换 px，并且限制最大和最小值。
- postcss-extract-media-query，[*https://github.com/SassNinja/postcss-extract-media-query*](https://github.com/SassNinja/postcss-extract-media-query)，postcss 插件，用于分离媒体查询。
- media-query-plugin，[*https://github.com/SassNinja/media-query-plugin*](https://github.com/SassNinja/media-query-plugin)，webpack 插件，用于分离媒体查询，可以配合其它 webpack 插件使用，例如 [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin)、[mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin)。
- scale-view，[*https://github.com/wswmsword/scale-view*](https://github.com/wswmsword/scale-view)，运行时转换伸缩尺寸，可用于框架中的行内样式，查看 [#17](https://github.com/wswmsword/postcss-mobile-forever/issues/17)。

对于包含块，插件默认的处理方式不能处理下面的情况，如果某个情况设置在祖先元素上，那么当前定位为 fixed 元素的包含块就是那个祖先元素，而插件默认所有的 fixed 元素的包含块是浏览器窗口（visual viewport）：
- transform 或 perspective 的值不是 none；
- will-change 的值是 transform 或 perspective；
- filter 的值不是 none 或 will-change 的值是 filter（只在 Firefox 下生效）；
- contain 的值是 paint（例如：`contain: paint;`）；
- backdrop-filter 的值不是 none（例如：`backdrop-filter: blur(10px);`）。
